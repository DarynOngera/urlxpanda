## API Integration

The extension connects to the URLXpanda backend API running on `localhost:8000`. The API provides:

- Open Graph metadata extraction
- Safety analysis (HTTPS, suspicious domains)

## Privacy & Security

- All URL expansion happens locally through your own server
- No data is sent to external services
- URLs are processed through your local URLXpanda instance
- Safety warnings help identify potentially malicious links
